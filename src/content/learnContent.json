It ensures that users on mobile devices with smaller screens don't have to download large, high-resolution images intended for desktop displays. This saves bandwidth, reduces page load times, and improves the overall performance of your website."

You also use the `sizes` attribute to inform the browser about the size of the image relative to the viewport."

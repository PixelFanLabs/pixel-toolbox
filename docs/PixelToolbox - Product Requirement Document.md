## **5\. User Stories & Acceptance Criteria**

### **5.1 Batch Processing**

**As a** Web Designer  
 **I want to** drop multiple images into the app  
 **So that** I can apply settings to all at once

**AC:**

* Given the user has dragged & dropped 3 images onto the dropzone  
   When thumbnails render with selection checkboxes  
   Then all images are selected by default and ready for settings

### **5.2 Auto-Optimization**

**As a** Marketer  
 **I want** intelligent compression  
 **So that** visual quality remains intact with minimal effort

**AC:**

* Given the user clicks “Optimize”  
   When processing completes (under 60s)  
   Then each image’s size is reduced ≥50% with quality difference ≤5% (visual diff)

### **5.3 Resize & Crop**

**As a** Content Creator  
 **I want** one-click presets  
 **So that** I don’t manually enter dimensions

**AC:**

* Given the user selects the “Banner (1200×300)” preset  
   When they click “Apply”  
   Then the preview updates to 1200×300 px

### **5.4 Export Presets**

**As a** Developer  
 **I want** CMS-ready exports  
 **So that** I can drop optimized files directly into my project

**AC:**

* Given the user chooses “CMS-ready”  
   When export completes  
   Then the ZIP contains `image1_webp`, `image2_avif`, etc., optimized per preset

### **5.5 UI Polish**

**As any** user  
 **I want** clear hover and focus states  
 **So that** I know where my keyboard and mouse interactions are active

**AC:**

* Given the user tabs through controls  
   When focus lands on a button  
   Then a 3 px dashed outline appears

## **6\. UX/UI Wireframes & Prototypes**

* Breakpoint: Desktop 1280×800  
* Key screens:  
  1. Onboarding dropzone  
  2. Settings panel  
  3. Preview & compare view  
  4. Export modal

---

## **7\. Technical & Non-Functional Requirements**

* Front-end: Jamstack architecture (e.g., React)  
* Hosting: Netlify free tier  
* Client-side only; no file data leaves the browser  
* Supported browsers: Latest Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge  
* Open-source code on GitHub

## **8\. Dependencies & Development Approach**

* **Design & Prototypes:** Me (UI polish via iterative “vibe‐code” sprints)  
* **Front-end Development:** Me (Jamstack on Netlify)  
* **Source Control & Hosting:** GitHub (public repo) & Netlify free tier

Development will follow an informal, personal-project cadence—no fixed timeline.

*   **Intuitive:** Using simple, direct language that guides users effortlessly through tasks, minimizing jargon.
*   **Light-hearted:** While professional, the voice avoids being overly formal or dry, incorporating a friendly and approachable undertone.

**Look & Feel:**
